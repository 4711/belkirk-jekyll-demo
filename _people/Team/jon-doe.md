Not tricks, Michael, illusions. That's why you always leave a note! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked! I'm a monster. I'm a monster. Whoa, this guy's straight? I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Army had half a day.

### I'm half machine. 

I'm a **monster**. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Army had half a day. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.

There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?

Well, what do you expect, _mother_? Across from where? That's why you always leave a note! There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.
